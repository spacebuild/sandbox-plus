# SandboxPlus, an S&box Game

Its built on top of [Sandbox Classic](https://github.com/Softsplit/sandbox) (which itself is a rewrite of Facepunch's Sandbox for the Scene system), with additions to make it more extendable (adding events, publicizing UI globals, etc), while staying unopinionated/light. The goal is "Gmod 2", replicating the functionality found in Gmod's Sandbox gamemode (with improvements).

For the old version using the Entity system, see [2023-entity-system](https://github.com/Nebual/sandbox-plus/tree/2023-entity-system) branch.

# Still very WIP as of the Scene system, much of the below functionality is still being copied over

## Improvements over Facepunch/sandbox:

### Gameplay

- It exists (since Facepunch deleted theirs)
- Constraint tool: an omni-tool with all your classic Gmod constraints (weld/axis/rope/elastic/slider/ballsocket)
- Duplicator tool
- Material tool
- Toolgun model (wip)
- Undo/Redo System
- DynShapes spawnmenu: like PHX, but dynamic, fully customizable sizes using procedural meshes. Rectangles, cylinders, spheres, gears!
- UI tool panels, including ModelSelector with extendable `.spawnlist`'s

### Extensiblility

- `IStopUsing` entity interface
- [Many new events](EVENTS.md) (aiming to reproduce many of Gmod 1's), including "entity.spawned" event, "undo.add" event
